# 🏍️ Hype Bike – Used Motorcycle Sales Platform
Hype Bike is a web-based application designed to help used motorcycle dealers display and manage their inventory online.
This project was created as a system analysis simulation (System Analyst Portfolio), including process design (DFD), data relations (ERD), and UI prototyping in Figma.

## Project Objectives
Provide a used motorcycle sales platform with simple features for admins and customers:
- Admins can add, edit, and delete item inventory.
- Admins can set "Today's Offer" promotions on the main page.
- Customers can browse the motorcycle collection by brand and view motorcycle details.
